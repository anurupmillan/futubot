This is a sample knowledge document that would be used for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
It contains domain-specific information that can be used to enhance the AI's responses with accurate, contextual information.

Key Concepts of RAG:
1. Retrieval: The system searches through a knowledge base for relevant information
2. Augmentation: The retrieved information is combined with the AI's general knowledge
3. Generation: The final response is generated using both sources of information

Benefits of RAG:
- Improved accuracy through domain-specific knowledge
- Reduced hallucination by grounding responses in facts
- Better context awareness for specialized topics
